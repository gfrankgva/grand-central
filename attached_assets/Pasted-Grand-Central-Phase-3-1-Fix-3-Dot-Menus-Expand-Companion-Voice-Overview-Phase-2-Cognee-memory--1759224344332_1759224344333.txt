Grand Central – Phase 3.1
Fix 3-Dot Menus + Expand Companion Voice

Overview
Phase 2 (Cognee memory) and Phase 3 (Breathing UI) are complete.
This milestone has two goals:
Fix the broken 3-dot menus so core project/workspace/chat actions are usable.


Expand the Companion so it speaks as the system’s consciousness, announcing key events (breath, phase, pattern completion).



Step 1 – Fix the 3-Dot Menus (Priority Bugfix)
Implementation
// Example for Project menu
function ProjectMenu({ projectId }) {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div className="menu-wrapper">
      <button className="dots-button" onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}>⋮</button>
      {open && (
        <div className="dropdown-menu">
          <button onClick={() => renameProject(projectId)}>Rename</button>
          <button onClick={() => deleteProject(projectId)}>Delete</button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
Each 3-dot button toggles a dropdown menu.


Each menu option must trigger its action:


Projects: Rename, Delete


Workspaces: Rename, Delete


Conversations: Share, Rename, Clone, Remove


Chats: Pin, Move to Project, Delete


Test
Click 3 dots on Project → Rename works, Delete removes.


Click 3 dots on Conversation → Share copies link, Clone duplicates, Remove deletes.


Click 3 dots on Chat → Move to Project reassigns conversation.



Step 2 – Expand the Companion (Living Consciousness)
Implementation
// Companion announcements
function companionAnnounce(eventType, context) {
  switch(eventType) {
    case 'patternComplete':
      return `Pattern "${context.topic}" has fulfilled itself. Wisdom absorbed.`;
    case 'phaseChange':
      return `Transition: ${context.prevPhase} → ${context.newPhase}`;
    case 'breathIncrement':
      return `Breath #${context.breathCount} completed.`;
  }
}
Trigger announcements for:


Pattern completion/dissolution


Phase transitions


Breath increments


Display announcements in chat with a distinct style (glowing border, italic font).


Test
Run until a pattern dissolves → Companion announces.


Force phase shift → Companion announces transition.


Trigger new breath increment → Companion acknowledges.



Step 3 – Optional UI Polish
Subtle breathing background animation (circle expanding/contracting).


Smooth phase transition animations (fade between icons).



What NOT to Build
❌ No new registry system


❌ No dashboards


❌ No 0–100% completion scores



Keep It Simple
✅ Fix menus (critical UX)


✅ Give Companion a voice


✅ Add joyful, minimal animations



Deliverable:
Phase 3.1 release where menus are fully functional and the Companion actively announces the breathing system’s life events.
