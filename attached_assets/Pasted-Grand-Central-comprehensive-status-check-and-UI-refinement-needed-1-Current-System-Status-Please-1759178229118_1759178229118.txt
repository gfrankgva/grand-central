Grand Central comprehensive status check and UI refinement needed:
1. Current System Status - Please Confirm What's Working:
LLM Integration:

✓/✗ Claude (Anthropic) responding?
✓/✗ GPT-4/GPT-5 (OpenAI) responding?
✓/✗ DeepSeek responding?
✓/✗ Grok (X.AI) responding?
✓/✗ All 4 LLMs respond simultaneously to messages?

Core Features:

✓/✗ Companion Agent suggests specialized agents after 3+ mentions?
✓/✗ Agent creation from Companion suggestions works?
✓/✗ Metrics Dashboard tracking performance?
✓/✗ System Context document loaded and affecting LLM behavior?
✓/✗ Global Context (files/URLs) available to all LLMs?

UI Elements:

✓/✗ 3-column layout working?
✓/✗ Files/Conversations tabs in middle column?
✓/✗ Resizable columns?

2. New UI Approach - Stack LLM Responses:
Instead of 4 separate columns, implement stacked responses like this:
typescriptinterface ChatInterface {
  // Top section: LLM toggles
  activeModels: {
    gpt4: boolean,
    claude: boolean, 
    deepseek: boolean,
    grok: boolean
  },
  
  // Chat area: Stacked responses
  messageDisplay: {
    userMessage: string,
    responses: [
      { llm: 'gpt-5', content: string, color: 'blue' },
      { llm: 'claude-sonnet-4', content: string, color: 'purple' },
      { llm: 'deepseek', content: string, color: 'green' },
      { llm: 'grok', content: string, color: 'gray' }
    ]
  }
}
UI Changes Needed:

Add toggle buttons at top: 'Active Models: [GPT-5] [Claude] [DeepSeek] [Grok]'
Stack responses vertically with clear LLM labels
Add 'Mark as In Chat' option for each response
Single input field at bottom for all LLMs
Cleaner than 4 columns - more space for actual content

3. Quick Functionality Test:
Run this test sequence:

Enable all 4 LLMs in Settings
Create new discussion
Send: 'Hello everyone, what is your role in this system?'
Expected responses:

GPT: Practical implementation focus
Claude: Pattern and connection focus
DeepSeek: Critical analysis focus
Grok: Metrics and efficiency focus


After 10 messages, Grok should provide optimization insights

4. Current Blockers or Issues?
Please list any:

API connection problems
UI bugs
Performance issues
Missing features

Priority: Get all 4 LLMs responding first, then refine the UI to the cleaner stacked approach."
